Speed, Acceleration and Deceleration
I find a lot of people out there chasing crazy acceleration numbers with their 3d printers (particularly the core XY crew) and find this a little bonkers.
Whilst acceleration will genuine reduce your print time, it seems to have become a focus and we are not all looking at the big picture.

So this little article is my meager attempt to encourage people to think about the whole thing!!

The speed that you can print at is dependent on how much filament you can flow, the acceleration you can achieve, the decceleration you can achieve, the weight of your tool head and how it affects your input shaping results, and cooling!
Unless all of these are balanced, your leaving performance on the table.
You can have the ability to accelerate at crazy levels, but unless you can control decceleration, cooling, and vibration in the toolhead, it will have limited effect.
Most CoreXY printers will deccel at 50% of acceleration, this means the control is not up to muster and will cause a longer print time. By fine tuning deceleration, you will reduce your print times
Unless you can cool the printed plastic appropriately, you will need to slow down.
If your tool head is heavy, your input shaper results will be lower accelerations
And there is no point to be able to accelerate like crazy unless you can push the plastic because ultimately a lesser flow will result in diminishing returns on the higher accelerations.
Much beyond 5000 mm/s/s is pointless unless you can push 30mm2 a second. If you look at the graphs, you will see that there is a big difference in accel times and ultimately deccel times as well when you jump from 1000mm/s/s to 5000mm/s/s however once you jump up to 20000mm/s/s that return is less than 10% gain at 30mm2
Jump to 50000mm/s/s and its even less again. 
Unless you start pushing 40-45mm2, those accels don't really help, they may only save you a couple of seconds on your print job.
